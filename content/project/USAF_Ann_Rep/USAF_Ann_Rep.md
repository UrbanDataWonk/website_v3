title: USAF Annual Report
summary: At USAFacts, I collaborated on a team to produce an Annual Report describing demographic and economic trends for the United States.

Data was collected over a number of months directly from federal data sources. These primarily included the U.S. Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Once collected, the data was staged to a database, fact-checked by other members of the team, and then audited by an outside auditing team. These data were then committed to the digital platform.

Given my expertise, I worked with our graphic designer to produce infographics related to population trends, wages distributions across the states, educational attainment levels, transportation and aging infrastructure, commutation trends, energy consumption and production, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, and severe weather and natural disasters. I also wrote copy for these sections of the report.
