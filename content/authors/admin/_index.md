I'm a Seattle-based researcher who loves digging into complex data, boiling it down for technical and lay audiences, and sharing insights from those investigations. I have over a decade of experience making sense of thorny public policy questions and working with journalists, public officials, academics, clients, and NGOs to build understanding for institutional change.

In my freetime, I am an avid outdoors enthusiast spending summers cycling long-distances and winters skiing the Cascades. As an Eagle Scout, I feel most at home exploring remote destinations in my home of the Pacific Northwest.
