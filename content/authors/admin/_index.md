I'm a Seattle-based researcher who loves digging into complex data, boiling it down for technical and lay audiences, and sharing insights from those investigations. I have over a decade of experience making sense of thorny public policy questions and working with journalists, public officials, academics, clients, and NGOs to build understanding for institutional change.

As a Senior Researcher at USAF, I took my deep knowledge of government data and helped envision, design, and launch the first state data on the platform. Compiled from over 80 government sources, I worked in collaboration with six vendors involved in UX, UI, web design, data scraping, and data management to bring public data to life.

During my tenure at GJF, I helped author over 30 public policy reports on best practices in economic development covered in national newspapers of record. My work has been cited by statehouses, and I've delivered testimony before numerous public officials including a sitting Governor and a special session of a state legislature. In 2013, our work was deemed notable by the Library of Congress and selected for permanent preservation as an historically important public policy record. In 2015, the organization was recognized by State Tax Notes as an "organization of the year." I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Greg LeRoy for his mentorship in developing my voice as a writer and my communications skills in dealing with journalists.

During and immediately following graduate school, I worked in city planning consulting. At KKC, I built a three-dimensional model of downtown Paducah, KY featured in Planning Magazine. I also worked on comprehensive plans classifying land use patterns, mocking up zoning impacts, mapping sensitive areas, and analyzing public services. I am forever grateful to my mentor Lane Kendig who taught me a lifetime of insights about land use planning and zoning. At Economic Stewardship, Inc., I worked for cities and counties preparing demographic and economic analyses for economic portions of comprehensive plans, heritage tourism services, and market feasibility analysis.

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I participated in a highly-selective accelerated Bachelor's and Master's program in Urban and Regional Planning. During my tenure at Illinois, I was elected to student government where I co-authored a student referenudum called the Sustainable Campus Fee (SCE). I later served on the committee which has since funded numerous campus sustainability projects.

In my freetime, I am an avid outdoors enthusiast. As an Eagle Scout, I feel most at home exploring remote destinations in my home of the Pacific Northwest, often on a bicycle. I typically ride a few thousand miles a year. More recently, I've started skiing; in my first season, I skied the vertical elevation of the Seven Summits in a single month.
